todo::

[ ] - allow users to create account/login
    [ ] - also need to load/check todo on server periodically??
            (in case user changed it from another client)

[ ] - reminders? due dates? autoorganize by date/reminder?
    [ ] - should get due date to store time/date on todo item
        - represent text as "text @ time - date"
    [ ] - tab should move from text input to date to allow selection
    [ ] - pressing tab after should cycle back
    [ ] - pressing enter at any time should try to add todo

 For me i.r.l at the moment, my best work organization is a combination of:
 https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-notes-alpha/dnghgncclglnalfilefbdpoflgajhdpo?hl=en-US
 and emails/tabs
 
 Additionally, i.r.l. for personal projects, the best approach is evernote and habitica
